This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project was made by [Animesh Mohanty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hokage7).

First install all the libraries and tools in package.json fileusing the command "npm -i"

To start the website in a localhost server,open the projec directory in command prompt and use the command: "yarn start" which will pwer up the "react-scripts-start" and the lite-server. The website application generally opens up in localhost:3000 port.

I have made use of React.Js making use of reactstrap,react-router-dom, React-Redux, Redux-Logger, Redux-Thunk along with features like single page applications, animations etc.
